# jQuery Date Time Picker #

Version: 1.0
Author: Jesse Sutherland (jessesutherland06@gmail.com)  
Build Date: 2010-10-14  
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.4+

Automatically enables the [jQuery Date Picker](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker) on the "Publish" screen in the Symphony administration.

This extension is really just a copy of Max Wheeler's jQuery Date Picker extension, coupled with Trent Richardson's [Time Picker](http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/) addon with some Symphony-esque CSS added by me. Special thanks to both Max and Trent.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the 'jquery_datetime_picker' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "jQuery Date Time Picker", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. All done. Any Date fields on your Publish pages will have the date time picker enabled.

## Notes

* The date format is currently set as: 10/14/1982. The format can be changed by editing the initialise.js file in accordance with the formatting instructions at: [http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/%24.datepicker.formatDate](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/%24.datepicker.formatDate)
